 GER_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Wilhelm II was born in the Kingdom of Prussia, under the rule of his great uncle, Frederick William IV. He would rise to power as a result of the misfortunes of his family. First, his grandfather would take power upon the death of Frederick; it would be he who formed the German Empire in 1871. In 1888, Wilhelm II would ascend the throne in the wake of the tragic death of his grandfather and then father, in the span of just four months. While he loved his family, he refused to be left in their shadow. As his namesake had forged a new empire for the German people, he would strengthen it. None would laugh at Germany, or take advantage of his people. \n\n Through a series of diplomatic crises and an economic and military buildup, Wilhelm would lead the German Empire into a new age; if Germany could not always be stronger than his enemies, he could always be more aggressive. The new friends and rivals that the empire acquired along this path would ultimately lead to The Weltkrieg, where all the nations of Earth battle each other for dominance. In spite of initial German successes, Wilhelm privately has begun to wonder if German will ever secure victory. When Wilhelm was born, there was no Germany. By the time this calamitous war is over, he fears that Germany may once again be no more."
