 germany.1.d:0 "January 1st, 1917: My grandfather, my namesake, beat France in just six months. With an astonishing victory, Germany was birthed, and Wilhelm I was crowned emperor. My own generals swore that this miraculous feat could be replicated, some had even promised they could do better than those who had come before them. At first, I had no doubts. The German army swept through Belgium in mere weeks and established a larger front against our true enemy, the French. Even when this offensive halted, when we were forced to do battle over mere scraps of territory in the West, I was still optimistic. Perhaps it would not be the swift defeat that I had been promised, but my generals assured me that we would outlast them. Our industrial might would crush our enemies in the long term, my advisors swore to me. Even in the face of many of the established empires of the world, my empire held strong. Then the United States entered the war, and the paradigm shifted. A nation so much like us, young and ambitious, with an enormous economy. My thrice-damned advisors also promised me this would never happen, that the people of the United States would never support war with us. Wrong again. \n\n At the start of the war, I had feared that we may not be respected by our allies; Germany, a young power, compared to the Austrians and Ottomans, both many centuries of age. That fear was quickly replaced with the concern that Germany alone was led by competent men. The Ottomans have been fully preoccupied with dueling the Arabs over the worthless desert, and the Austrian failed to mobilize against the Russians in time to prevent a humiliating loss of land. These fortunes have been reversed to some degree, but I am no longer certain it shall be enough. Even if Germany does manage to destroy the French, that will only lengthen the front against the allies; we cannot allow another Battle of Jutland, which might end more decisively against us. Can Germany truly win this war? Would such a victory even be worth it for the cost of blood and material? My generals swear to it, but when have they ever been right? No, I believe we must find a way out of this war, at whatever price, and by any means necessary."
