 germany.1.d:0 "January 1st, 1917: My grandfather, my namesake, beat France in just six months. With an astonishing victory, Germany was birthed, and Wilhelm I was crowned emperor. My own generals swore that this miraculous feat could be replicated, some had even promised they could do better than those who had come before them. At first, I had no doubts. The German army swept through Belgium in mere weeks and established a larger front against our true enemy, the French. Even when this offensive halted, when we were forced to do battle over mere scraps of territory in the West, I was still optimistic. Perhaps it would not be the swift defeat that I had been promised, but my generals assured me that we would outlast them. Our industrial might would crush our enemies in the long term, my advisors swore to me. Even in the face of many of the established empires of the world, my empire held strong. Then the United States entered the war, and the paradigm shifted. A nation so much like us, young and ambitious, with an enormous economy. My thrice-damned advisors also promised me this would never happen, that the people of the United States would never support war with us. Wrong again. \n\n At the start of the war, I had feared that we may not be respected by our allies; Germany, a young power, compared to the Austrians and Ottomans, both many centuries of age. That fear was quickly replaced with the concern that Germany alone was led by competent men. The Ottomans have been fully preoccupied with dueling the Arabs over the worthless desert, and the Austrian failed to mobilize against the Russians in time to prevent a humiliating loss of land. These fortunes have been reversed to some degree, but I am no longer certain it shall be enough. Even if Germany does manage to destroy the French, that will only lengthen the front against the allies; we cannot allow another Battle of Jutland, which might end more decisively against us. Can Germany truly win this war? Would such a victory even be worth it for the cost of blood and material? My generals swear to it, but when have they ever been right? No, I believe we must find a way out of this war, at whatever price, and by any means necessary."
 germany.2.d:0 "Once, these meetings were little more than formalities, Kaiser Wilhelm thought to himself. Before this damn war broke out. The mood had been celebratory at the time, as Germany laid its enemies low in the west. Now, when the war was at a precipice, each high command meeting was critical. Today, the General Staff of the empire assembled to review the status of the war, as well as Germany’s options. It would be Erich Ludendorff who began the meeting, “Gentlemen, the entrance of the United States into the conflict has changed the dynamic of the war. The past year has shown us that a swift victory in the west is likely impossible, we must therefore ponder other options.” Paul von Hindenburg was quick to answer: “The east, that is where we find our best options. It is by far the most fluid, and the easiest to manage. With the Balkans largely secured, and the Russians stalled in their invasion of the Caucasus, we should move against them.” Many in the room nodded. \n\n Wilhelm could not help but feel a twinge of irritation, had it not been some of these very men who had rejected his proposal to focus upon Russia at the outbreak of the war? Pushing these feelings aside, he began to speak, “I am inclined to agree. Not only is the eastern front more flexible, but Russia itself is by far the least stable.” The words of the German Emperor might not mean as much as they once had, but both Ludendorff and Hindenburg seemed relieved that he had agreed. It was then that a representative from the Austro-Hungarian Empire spoke up, “The Alpine front also has some potential, we’ve stalled the Italian advance for the time being, and believe with significant pressure we might dislodge them from their positions." Many of the German commanders exchanged a look with each other. Their opinion of the competence of the Austrians had yet to recover from the Brusilov offensive, but it would certainly be worthwhile if they could truly secure a victory. After a brief pause Ludendorff provided a brief summation, “Very well, we shall concentrate our efforts upon knocking the Russians out of the war, and lend assistance to the Austrians against Italy. Success on either front would shorten our fronts.""
