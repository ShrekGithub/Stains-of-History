 GER_the_oncoming_fear:0 "The Oncoming Fear"
 GER_the_oncoming_fear_desc:0 "None could have predicted the sheer carnage that this war would bring. What should have been a brief campaign to allow the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires to demonstrate their might, has instead turned into a bloody great war. The war in the west has stalled, and only costly campaigns in the east have stopped the Russians from advancing into the lands of the Central Powers. As the casualties mount over scraps of land, Kaiser Wilhelm is left to wonder whom he can trust. He was promised the war would be short, and his advisors swore the United States would not enter the war. Both wrong. Now, when his staff promises that the German Empire can outlast the plethora of enemies it faces, he is uncertain. Can the words of such studious and intelligent men be trusted if they have been wrong at so many critical junctions of late?"
 GER_meet_with_the_generals:0 "Meet With the Generals"
 GER_meet_with_the_generals_desc:0 "The west has stalled, and our offensives in the area are far from what any sane man would call a success. Our current plans are not working, as we concentrate our efforts upon a brutal eternal stalemate with the brunt of the Allied forces. We must adapt to the situation if we are to secure victory for the Fatherland. To this effect, the German high command shall meet together to discuss the events of the war, as well as possible options. Outside of the western front which we have found ourselves obsessed with, there have been major developments along the eastern front, as well as in Italy, the Balkans, and even the Middle East. We must carefully consider each of these, and search out any opportunities that we might seize upon. Germany was born from the efforts of the General Staff in the past, and we pray that it shall be preserved by it now."
 GER_endless_suffering:0 "Endless Suffering"
 GER_endless_suffering_desc:0 "The Western Front has been locked in a brutal stalemate for years, and millions lie dead. With every failed offensive, the great powers of the world bleed themselves dry for mere inches of ground. We have already resolved to focus our efforts on other fronts, in areas that are more conducive to change. Unfortunately, this does not mean that we cannot simply abandon the Western Front, or allow the Allies to advance. While we secure victory in other areas, we must grind any Allied offensive to a halt in the west, whatever the cost. They cannot be allowed to enter the Fatherland, no matter how much German blood must be shed to prevent this. However many men must suffer on this front, the alternative is simply unthinkable to the Fatherland."
 GER_reconsider_our_troop_deployment:0 "Reconsider our Troop Deployment"
 GER_reconsider_our_troop_deployment_desc:0 "While we cannot simply abandon the Western Front, the recently stalled offensives have given us some leeway. For the entire war thus far, we have committed many of our troops to the west and a smaller portion to the east; although we had to draw on the east to support our recent offensives, these troops may now be returned. If we abandon the idea of a crushing victory in the west, we can pull back a number of troops while still comfortably retaining enough to hold back Allied offensives. In this process, we should consider the very nature of their deployments. With the shift of strategy to focus on Russia, we will need to commit a huge number of men to fight them, alongside our Austrian brothers. Another opportunity is also available, on the Alpine Front. While we have thus far had little involvement in the area, our ally promises us they can achieve a breakthrough with our support."
 GER_every_man_a_soldier:0 "Every Man a Soldier"
 GER_every_man_a_soldier_desc:0 "It is the duty of every German man to serve his Fatherland. At one point, this had meant he would work in any number of roles, from butcher to doctor, performing his duties to the best of his abilities for the furthering of the empire. No longer. Germany has embarked upon a Total War against its enemies. It needs men to crush the nations that would dare to challenge it, and the means to arm them. Everything else is secondary. If a man does not already serve as the former or latter, we must make him available for war. Certainly, some men are physically unable to fight, in which case we shall mobilize them domestically for the factories. For the others, we shall lengthen conscription, and broaden the draft standards. The Weltkrieg gorges itself upon the blood of good men, but we cannot afford to be the first to stop feeding it."
 GER_the_eastern_tide:0 "The Eastern Tide"
 GER_the_eastern_tide_desc:0 "The Eastern Front is the only part of the war to meet the world’s expectations. Grand movements of huge numbers of troops dueling for strategic positions across a large front, this is what we had expected the entirety of the war might look like, on both fronts. How foolish we were. With the Western Front perpetually bogged down, we must focus our efforts on the East, that is where we shall secure the first victory. Although the emergency of the Romanian entrance into the war has been resolved, and Russian offensives blunted, we now must prepare for the brutal and long campaign by which we might secure victory. The Eastern Tide shall be turned, whatever the cost. The armies of the Central Powers may need to march across the plains of Europe into the Russian Heartland if that is what must be done for victory. We must steel ourselves, and plunge forth."
 GER_contact_lenin:0 "Contact Lenin"
 GER_contact_lenin_desc:0 "In spite of what the oppositional parties might say, our government, and the SPD itself, have no love for the Communists. Nevertheless, they offer us an incredible opportunity against the crippled Russian Empire. The lands that were once among the most conservative in Europe are filled with talks of revolution, and the peasants cry out for change. The kindling of societal collapse grows denser every passing day, all that it lacks is a spark. One that we shall provide, in the form of  Vladimir Lenin. A Russian Communist dissident in exile, we shall give him the means to return to Russia, and destabilize our enemy. While the rise of a Communist Russia is certainly contrary to our wishes, our advisors tell us any civil war in Russia would be brutal and drawn out. Exactly what we need to knock the Russian Empire out of the war, that we might concentrate upon our other enemies."
 GER_aid_the_bolsheviks:0 "Aid the Bolsheviks"
 GER_aid_the_bolsheviks_desc:0 "The Communists rise, and the Russian Empire falters! Lenin has done it. Certainly, it is time for celebration, but we cannot afford to grow complacent. The Bolsheviks are severely outnumbered, and outgunned, by the Imperial Russian forces. While they have mobilized a huge number of young workers, they face the might of the Russian Army. If they are to be a lasting threat to the stability of Russia, they will need aid, which we shall be eager to provide. We shall flood the Red forces with all the guns and artillery that they might need to consume the Russian Empire. Should this civil war continue, it would rid us of a front of more than 1,500 kilometers in length, and allow us to concentrate on a victory in the west. All efforts must be made to support this enemy of our enemy."
 GER_keinen_schritt_zurueck:0 "Keinen Schritt Zurück"
 GER_keinen_schritt_zurueck_desc:0 "Germany has been forced on the defensive, something that goes against the plans of the General Staff, and the very nature of its people. Unfortunately, our wishes have had little bearing on reality in this war. Therefore, we must declare, Keinen Schrift Züruck! Not one step back. The Fatherland will fight itself bloody for every inch of ground on the Western Front, to prevent any Allied offensive. The enemy can never be permitted to enter German land. The second the Allied boots should touch German soil it would send them into a frenzy, unlike anything we’ve ever seen, drawing out the war inexorably. Even if we should secure victory in the Western Campaign, we would be forced to negotiate terms with the nigh-untouchable British Empire and the United States, something much easier done if we have demonstrated our own untouchability."
 GER_treaty_of_brest_litovsk:0 "Treaty of Brest-Litovsk"
 GER_treaty_of_brest_litovsk_desc:0 "We have done it! The Eastern Front has been effectively resolved. The Bolshevik government has reached out to us to secure peace terms, in order that they might focus on fighting the remnants of Imperial Russia. Not only have we freed up millions of men from this front, but also secured very significant concessions of land and money from the Bolsheviks, to further our war effort. With the signing of the treaty, millions of German men, and many more Austrians, are no longer needed for the Eastern Front, and may now be redeployed. The opportunities are endless; while many will be sent to the Western Front, we might also consider other locations. The Alpine Front is still very much an option, and some have even suggested sending some troops to aid the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East; if we can cut the cord of the British Empire in the Suez Canal, we might more easily force them into a peace agreement."
 GER_all_eyes_on_west_now:0 "All Eyes on the West Now"
 GER_all_eyes_on_west_now_desc:0 "With the Eastern Front won, many men head West. The Austrians will arrive in force along the western trenches for the first time in the Welterkrieg, with a smaller number of returning German soldiers. We are no longer burdened with the huge and fluid front we once had with the Russian Empire. We have reinforced the Western Front with millions of Germans and many more Austrians. For the first time in memory, we outnumber the Allies in the west. Perhaps we shall never achieve the swift and decisive victory that we dreamed of against France. But we shall win. Even if we must grind our enemies into dust for every scrap of land, we go forward. We have the numbers, the morale, and the initiative. The eyes of the world rest upon the Western Front, and we shall not disappoint."
