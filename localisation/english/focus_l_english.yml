 GER_the_oncoming_fear_desc:0 "None could have predicted the sheer carnage that this war would bring. What should have been a brief campaign to allow the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires to demonstrate their might, has instead turned into a bloody great war. The war in the west has stalled, and only costly campaigns in the east have stopped the Russians from advancing into the lands of the Central Powers. As the casualties mount over scraps of land, Kaiser Wilhelm is left to wonder whom he can trust. He was promised the war would be short, and his advisors swore the United States would not enter the war. Both wrong. Now, when his staff promises that the German Empire can outlast the plethora of enemies it faces, he is uncertain. Can the words of such studious and intelligent men be trusted if they have been wrong at so many critical junctions of late?"

 GER_meet_with_the_generals_desc:0 "The west has stalled, and our offensives in the area are far from what any sane man would call a success. Our current plans are not working, as we concentrate our efforts upon a brutal eternal stalemate with the brunt of the Allied forces. We must adapt to the situation if we are to secure victory for the Fatherland. To this effect, the German high command shall meet together to discuss the events of the war, as well as possible options. Outside of the western front which we have found ourselves obsessed with, there have been major developments along the eastern front, as well as in Italy, the Balkans, and even the Middle East. We must carefully consider each of these, and search out any opportunities that we might seize upon. Germany was born from the efforts of the General Staff in the past, and we pray that it shall be preserved by it now."
